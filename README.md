Blockchain technology has obviously captured the attention of a substantial number of people, some of whom are aspiring developers, a group that I belong to. But, at least for me, the learning curve is equivalent to the Mongells trying to overcome great wall of China. 
 
A little background first. I fit in the category of coders who are self-taught and as a self-taught coder there is a large void in my understanding. As an example, I have always known that development required the use of an array of interconnected frameworks that make a system function. However, what I did not know is that this was called a tech stack... 
 
So, this is a resource dedicated to these people, my people, the people like me. The large swaths of aimless souls crawling on the surface of true development. The reason for building this resource is to anchor myself. To act as a starting point for my development career, which to this point has been non-existent. 
 
Enough story telling lets get into it. 
 
Obviously the first thing is to setup the environment, lets start there. 


## Environment Setup

I will assume that because it's 2022 your setup is Windows 10/11 runing `WSL 2`.
If `WSL 2` is not setup on your system check out this resource before moving on.

Cooming Soon. A few resources I need to compile to make this as straight forward as possible.
